# News_Classification_Gensim
I gonna use pre trained word2vec model to preprocess the text and vectorize it
# First I gonna use "gensim.downloader" and load word2vec model trained on google news and check class balance in my dataset, my data in almost perfect
# Then I change label column into numeric values mapping label column into 0 and 1 and check change in my dataset
